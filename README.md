This is the repository for a presentation I held at the working group on "the Digitalization of Societies and Methods" at the Annual Conference of the  Westermarck Society (also known as the Finnish Sociology Days).

The presentation included two parts. The first part is an illustration of how tweets from a hashtag can be placed on a map, despite sparse geodata. This part was done with Python and the tweepy library as well as Open Refine and CartoDB. A description of the process can be found in a [blogpost](https://mikaelbrunila.fi) I wrote on my personal website.

The second part illustrates how pages supporting (and some opposing) the far right group Soldiers of Odin spread on Facebook between December 2015 and February 2017. The point is to show how the brand grew and spread to new places over time. This part was done with R and the library rFacebook as well as Open Refine and CartoDB. Some documentation can besides the R script in this repository, be found in the pdf with the presentation I did at te conference.

The maps produced in both cases can be seen below:
